        "\n# Align time-frequency representations according to phase peak\n\n\nThis example illustrates how to realign time-frequency representations\naccording to a phase. In particular, a time-point of reference is first\ndefined (`cue`). Then, the closest peak phase is found around this cue and the\nphase is shifted so that the peak of the phase is aligned with the cue.\nFinally, the same shift is then applied to the time-frequency representation.\nFor an extended description, see :class:`tensorpac.utils.PeakLockedTF`\n\nThis realignment can be a great tool to visualize the emergence of a\nphase-amplitude coupling according to a specific phase.\n\n"
