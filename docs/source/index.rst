Tensorpac
#########

Tensorpac is an Python open-source toolbox for computing Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) using tensors and parallel computing. On top of that, we designed a modular implementation with a relatively large amount of parameters.

This package was developped in collaboration with **Juan L.P. Soto**
