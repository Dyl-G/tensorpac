**Measure Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) on electrophysiological data**

.. note::
    This section includes :

    * how to compute and plot PAC (local or distant)
    * how to compute the surrogate distribution and use it to improve the reliability of the measure
    * how to get p-values
    * comparisons of existing methodologies and filtering properties
